# Vlad's Article Highlight

The article I am highlighting is called [Collection of insane and fun facts about SQLite](https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-facts/).

This is a really fun article which introduced me to what [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) really is and why it's different from other 'database systems'.
Most database management systems, such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), run on a server (which can be a process on the same machine, or on another machine).
They are usually pretty 'heavy,' as in they take up a decent amount of space to set up and use.
On the other hand, they're extremely optimized and have a ton of features.
SQLite is different and they basically call it 'a replacement for `fopen`.'
Basically, it is extremely light-weight and can be included anywhere as a header-only C library or through another language API.
It doesn't have many features, but it's extremely fast.
They call it a replacement for `fopen` because it is almost as fast and works with SQL.
In other words, you can make a database for your application, and SQLite facilitates this while being light-weight and taking minimal setup.
It seems ideal for small applications.

With this context in mind, I encourage you to read the article. *My favorite facts are 1, 9, 14, and 17.*

### Notes from Boubacar Ballo

Really cool article! I have never used SQLite myself but I've only heard good things about it. My favorite fact is definitely 5. Super cool that it all came down to making an operations on a battleship more efficient to have the tool we got today.
